             Double Deep Q-Learning and Faster R-CNN-Based Autonomous Vehicle Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance in Dynamic Environment</a></h5>
           <p align="justify">Autonomous vehicle navigation in an unknown dynamic environment is crucial for both supervised- and Reinforcement Learning-based autonomous maneuvering. The cooperative fusion of these two learning approaches has the potential to be an effective mechanism to tackle indefinite environmental dynamics. Most of the state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle navigation systems are trained on a specific mapped model with familiar environmental dynamics. However, this research focuses on the cooperative fusion of supervised and Reinforcement Learning technologies for autonomous navigation of land vehicles in a dynamic and unknown environment. The Faster R-CNN, a supervised learning approach, identifies the ambient environmental obstacles for untroubled maneuver of the autonomous vehicle. Whereas, the training policies of Double Deep Q-Learning, a Reinforcement Learning approach, enable the autonomous agent to learn effective navigation decisions form the dynamic environment. The proposed model is primarily tested in a gaming environment similar to the real-world. It exhibits the overall efficiency and effectiveness in the maneuver of autonomous land vehicles.

							Reinforcement Learning Based Autonomous Vehicle for Exploration and Exploitation of Undiscovered Track</a></h5>
						<p align="justify">This research focuses on autonomous traversal of land vehicles through exploring undiscovered tracks and overcoming environmental barriers. Most of the existing systems can only operate and traverse in a distinctive mapped model especially in a known area. However, the proposed system which is trained by Deep Reinforcement Learning can learn by itself to operate autonomously in extreme conditions. The dynamic double deep Q-learning (DDQN) model enables the proposed system not to be conﬁned only to known environments. The ambient environmental obstacles are identiﬁed through Faster R-CNN for smooth movement of the autonomous vehicle. The exploration and exploitation strategies of DDQN enables the autonomous agent to learn proper decisions for various dynamic environments and tracks. The proposed model is tested in a gaming environment. It shows the overall eﬀectiveness in traversing of autonomous land vehicles in comparison to the existing models. The goal is to integrate Deep Reinforcement learning and Faster R-CNN to make the system eﬀective to traverse through undiscovered paths by detecting obstacles.

						<h5><a href="#">A Smart Rail Gate Automation System
						</a></h5>
						<p align="justify"> It is well known that level crossing gates are operated manually with the aid of a gate keeper. This human intervention can be prevented by means of automating the gates of railway level crossing. In situations where the train is late for some reason, the gates continue to be closed for longer periods causing dense traffic near the gates. This can be prevented as well with the usage of automation. The proposed device uses infra crimson sensors to come across the arrival and departure of trains on the railway crossing and Arduino to manipulate the opening or closing of gates. The device also uses two IR sensors to locate the advent of the train and a third IR sensor to discover the departure of the train. At the same time, when the appearance of the train is sensed, signs or warnings are provided to the passers-by indicating the arrival of the train at the track. While the second sensor detects the train, the sign turns crimson and the motor operates to shut the gate. The gate remains closed until the train absolutely moves away from the gate. As the departure of the train is detected by the usage of the IR sensor, the visitors sign turns green and the motor operates to open the gate. Therefore, automation of rail gate is a safe step towards proper transportation system.

           <h5><a href="#">Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Real-time Monitoring of Water Bodies in Bangladesh
           </a></h5>
           <p align="justify"> In  this  project,  we  have  tried  to  develop  a  systemto  monitor  water  quality  data  of  some  water  bodies  in  Dhaka city  using  a  small  autonomous  hovering  boat.  It  is  a  matter of  concern  that  the  water  we  have  access  to  in  Bangladeshis  polluted  and  lacks  a  proper  monitoring  system.  To  manage and  protect  water,  reliable  and  dynamic  water  monitoring  is a   must.   Water   monitoring   systems   that   exist   today   require human  intervention  and  expensive  methodologies.  Moreover,  it is   difficult   to   gather,   analyze   and   index   water   quality   data using  these  conventional  systems.  This  problem  can  be  solved by  automating  the  process  and  reducing  the  dependency  onexisting  flawed  systems.  The  proposed  project  uses  a  miniature boat shaped automated hovering platform for mobility in water which  is  guided  by  a  GPS  and  compass.  The  device  consists  of several  water  quality  sensors  for  on-board  data  collection.  At the  same  time,  a  small  pump  is  used  to  collect  water  samples for  laboratory  tests  and  further  analysis.  Further,  the  system is  integrated  in  a  communication  system  to  autonomously  storedata  on  real  time  servers  through  internet  connectivity.  Being lightweight  and  rechargeable  the  portable  device  can  be  taken to  remote  places  conveniently.  Therefore,  this  autonomous  GPS guided  water  monitoring  system  can  have  a  positive  impact  on water quality monitoring as well as assessment of water quality parameters.
